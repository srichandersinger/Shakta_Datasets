1,1,OṀ aiṁ. Mārkaṇḍeya said:
1,2,"Sāvarṇi, who is Sūrya’s son, is called the eighth manu. Listen while I relate the story of his birth"
1,3,"and of how, by Mahāmāyā’s authority, he—the illustrious son of the sun god—came to be the lord of an age."
1,4,"Long ago in the age of the manu Svarociṣba, there arose from the line of Caitra a king named Suratha, who ruled over the whole earth."
1,5,"He looked after his subjects justly, as if they were his own children. But there were princes at that time who attacked the native hill tribes and became his enemies."
1,6,"Though mightily armed and resolved to fight against them, he suffered defeat in battle, despite his enemies’ inferior forces."
1,7,"And so, with only his native province left to rule, he returned to his own city. There, powerful adversaries set upon him, the illustrious Suratha,"
1,8,"now bereft of strength. His ministers, mighty, corrupted, and disposed to evil, seized power and plundered the treasury, even there in his own city."
1,9,"Thus robbed of his dominion, the king mounted his horse on the pretext of hunting and rode off alone into the dense forest."
1,10,"He came upon the hermitage of Medhas, chief among the twice-born, and beheld a forest retreat, graced by the sage’s disciples. There he saw beasts once wild now peacefully abiding."
1,11,"Welcomed by the sage, he remained at the hermitage for some time, wandering here and there about the enclosure."
1,12,"In that setting, self-centered concerns came to seize his mind, and he reflected:"
1,13,I have left behind the capital that my ancestors governed before me. Are my perverse officials overseeing it justly or not?
1,14,"My prized elephant, valiant and of unceasing prowess, has fallen into the hands of my enemies. I know not what comforts he’ll now enjoy."
1,15,"Those retainers of mine, constantly eager for favor, wealth, and feasting, now surely submit to other lords."
1,16,Their habitual squandering will soon deplete the wealth I so laboriously amassed.
1,17,"While pondering those and other questions, the king caught sight of a lone merchant approaching the sage’s hermitage."
1,18,"“Who are you,” he asked, “and what brings you here? Why do you look so sorrowful and dejected?”"
1,19,"Hearing the king speak in friendship, the merchant bowed respectfully and replied."
1,20,The merchant said:
1,21,"“I am a merchant named Samādhi, born in a wealthy family. My wife and children grew wicked through avarice and cast me out."
1,22,"Destitute of riches, wife, and children, my wealth taken from me, I have arrived in the forest, distressed and forsaken by trusted kinsmen."
1,23,"Being here, I know not whether good fortune or ill has befallen my children, wife, and family."
1,24,At present is well-being or misfortune theirs at home?
1,25,How are my children? Is their behavior virtuous or vile?”
1,26,The king said:
1,27,"“Those greedy sons, wife, and others who dispossessed you of your wealth—"
1,28,why does your mind still cherish them?”
1,29,The merchant said:
1,30,"“Even as you say it, this very thought occurs to me. But what can I do? My heart is not inclined to rancor"
1,31,"but still turns with affection to those who drove me away, scorning love for father, husband, and kinsman, out of lust for wealth."
1,32,"I recognize this, O wise one. Still, I do not understand how my thoughts are drawn in love to my unworthy kinsfolk."
1,33,"Because of them I sigh, overcome with despair."
1,34,"What can I do, since the pain has failed to harden my heart?”"
1,35,Mārkaṇḍeya said:
1,36,"Then together they approached the sage,"
1,37,"that merchant named Samādhi and Suratha, the best of kings."
1,38,"Having observed the respect that was the sage’s due, the merchant and the king sat down to tell their stories."
1,39,The king said:
1,40,"“Revered sir, I wish to ask you one thing. Please reply."
1,41,"Without control of my thoughts, my mind is coming to grief."
1,42,"I remain possessive toward my lost kingdom and all parts of the realm as if unaware that they are no longer mine. Venerable sage, how can this be?"
1,43,"And this fellow has been humiliated by his children and wife, deserted by his servants, and forsaken by his own people. Still he feels exceeding affection for them."
1,44,"It is the same with me. We both are distressed to the utmost, held by attachment to things, even though we see their faults."
1,45,"Venerable sir, how is it that we who should know better can be so deluded? Ours is the perplexity of those who are blind to right understanding.”"
1,46,The seer said:
1,47,"“Illustrious king, through the perceptions of the senses, every living being has knowledge of the manifest universe. The objects of sense-perception reveal themselves in various ways."
1,48,"Some creatures are blind by day, and others are blind by night. Some creatures see equally by day and night."
1,49,"Truly, humans are endowed with the power of perception, but they are not alone, for cattle, birds, wild animals, and all other living creatures also perceive."
1,50,"That awareness which humans have, birds and beasts possess also; and their awareness, humans have, too. In other ways also the two are similar."
1,51,"Look at these birds. Though feeling the pangs of hunger, out of delusion they still busy themselves by dropping food into the beaks of their young."
1,52,"Illustrious sir, humans long for offspring, surely expecting gratitude in return. Do you not see this?"
1,53,"In this very manner they are hurled into the whirlpool of attachment, the pit of delusion, by the power of Mahāmāyā, Who produces the continuing cycle of this transitory world."
1,54,"Do not be astonished. This same Mahāmāyā is Yoganidrā, the meditative sleep of Viṣṇu, the lord of the world. By Her this world is deluded."
1,55,"She, the blessed Goddess Mahāmāyā, seizes the minds of even the wise and draws them into delusion."
1,56,"She creates all this universe, moving and unmoving, and it is She Who graciously bestows liberation on humanity."
1,57,"She is the supreme knowledge and the eternal cause of liberation,"
1,58,even as She is the cause of bondage to this transitory existence. She is the sovereign of all lords.”
1,59,The king said:
1,60,"“Revered sir, Who is that Goddess whom you call Mahāmāyā? How did She originate, and in what ways does She Act?"
1,61,"And whatever Her Glory, this Goddess, whatever Her Form and Origin,"
1,62,"all that I wish to learn from you, who are supreme among the knowers of Brahman.”"
1,63,The seer said:
1,64,"“She Is Eternal, having the world as Her Form. She Pervades All This."
1,65,Yet She Emerges in various ways. Hear it from me.
1,66,"Although She Is Eternal, when She Manifests to accomplish the purpose of the Gods, She Is said to be Born in the world."
1,67,"At the end of the cosmic day, when the universe dissolved into the primordial ocean, the blessed lord Viṣṇu stretched out on the serpent Śeṣa and entered into meditative sleep."
1,68,"Then two fearsome asuras, the notorious Madhu and Kaiṭabha, issued forth from the wax in Viṣṇu’s ears, intent on slaying Brahmā,"
1,69,"who was seated on the lotus that grew from Viṣṇu’s navel. When he saw the raging asuras and the sleeping Viṣṇu,"
1,70,"Brahmā could think of nothing but to awaken him, and to that end he extolled Yoganidrā, Who had settled over Viṣṇu’s eyes"
1,71,"as his blessed sleep. The resplendent lord Brahmā extolled Her Who rules the universe, Who Sustains and Dissolves it. He extolled Her Who Is Incomparable."
1,72,Brahmā said:
1,73,"‘You Are The Mantras of Consecration to the Gods and the ancestors. At Your Bidding They Are Uttered, and they are your very embodiment. You Are The Nectar of Immortality, O Imperishable, Eternal One. Truly, You Abide As The Transcendent Being,"
1,74,"yet in every moment you abide, inseparable and inexpressible, as the eternal source of all becoming. Indeed You Are That. You Are Sāvitrī, the Source of All Purity and Protection; You Are the Supreme Mother of The Gods."
1,75,"By You is this universe supported, of You is this world born, by You is it protected, O Devī, and You always Consume it at the end."
1,76,"You Are the Creative Force at the World’s Birth and Its Sustenance for as long as it endures. So even at the end of this world, You Appear as Its Dissolution, You Who Encompass it all."
1,77,"You Are The Great Knowledge and The Great Illusion, The Great Intelligence, The Great Memory and The Great Delusion, The Great Goddess and The Great Demoness."
1,78,"You Are Primordial Matter, Differentiating into the Threefold Qualities of Everything. You Are The Dark Night Of Periodic Dissolution, The Great Night of Final Dissolution, and The Terrifying Night Of Delusion."
1,79,"You Are Radiant Splendor; You Reign Supreme Yet Are Unassuming; You Are The Light Of Understanding. Modesty Are You, And Prosperity, Contentment, Tranquillity and Forbearance."
1,80,"Armed With Sword And Spear, And With Club And Discus, Waging War With Conch, Bow And Arrows, Sling And Iron Mace, You Inspire Dread."
1,81,"Yet, You Are Pleasing, More Pleasing Than All Else That Is Pleasing, and Exceedingly Beautiful. Transcending Both Highest and Lowest, You Are Indeed The Supreme Sovereign."
1,82,"Whatever exists, true or untrue, and wherever it may be, O Soul of Everything, You Are The Power Of All That. How can I praise You?"
1,83,"By You, even he Who Creates, Protects, and Devours the world is Subdued with Sleep. Who here can praise You?"
1,84,"You have caused even Viṣṇu, Śiva, and Me to assume Our embodied forms. Who then can truly praise You?"
1,85,"Thus Extolled, O Devī, may You with Your Exalted Powers Confound Those Unassailable asuras, Madhu and Kaiṭabha."
1,86,"Let Viṣṇu, the lord of the world, be quickly awakened from his slumber"
1,87,and be roused to slay the two great asuras.’”
1,88,The seer said:.’”
1,89,"“Praised thus by the creator to rouse Viṣṇu into slaying Madhu and Kaiṭabha, then and there The Dark Goddess"
1,90,"Emerged from his eyes, mouth, nostrils, arms, heart, and chest, and appeared before Brahmā, Who is born from the Unmanifest."
1,91,"And released by Her, Viṣṇu, the Lord of the world, arose from his serpent couch on the undifferentiated ocean and beheld"
1,92,"the evil-natured Madhu and Kaiṭabha, exceedingly strong and courageous, seeing red with anger and determined to devour Brahmā."
1,93,"Then the blessed, all-pervading Viṣṇu rose up and fought with them in hand-to-hand combat for five thousand years."
1,94,"And they, mad with the arrogance of power and confounded By Mahāmāyā,"
1,95,"exclaimed to him, ‘Ask a boon from us! ’"
1,96,The blessed lord Viṣṇu said:
1,97,"‘Since you are pleased with me, so be it. I will surely slay both of you now."
1,98,What other boon is there to ask?”’
1,99,The seer said:
1,100,"“Thus deceived, and beholding that the world consisted entirely of water, they addressed the lotus-eyed Viṣṇu, saying:"
1,101,‘Slay us where water does not flood the earth.’”
1,102,The seer said:
1,103,"“‘So be it,’ said Viṣṇu, the wielder of conch, discus, and mace. Taking the two of them onto his lap, he cut off their heads with his discus."
1,104,"Thus did The Devī Herself appear when praised by Brahmā. Hear still more of Her Glory, which I will tell you.”"
2,1,OṀ hrīṁ. The seer said:
2,2,"“Long ago, when Mahiṣa was chief of the asuras and Indra was chief of the gods, there was a war between their forces for a full hundred years."
2,3,"The valorous asuras vanquished the army of the gods, and after all were conquered, Mahiṣa became the lord of heaven."
2,4,"Then led by Brahmā, the lord of beings, the defeated gods went to Viṣṇu and Śiva"
2,5,and related in detail what had happened. The thirty gods told how Mahiṣāsura had wrought their defeat:
2,6,"‘He has usurped the authority of Sūrya, Indra, Agni, Vāyu, and Candra, and of Yama, Varuṇa, and all the others."
2,7,"Cast out from heaven by the evil Mahiṣa, all the multitudes of gods wander over the earth as mere mortals."
2,8,"We have related all that this foe of the gods has done, and we seek refuge in You. Be pleased to devise a means for his destruction.’"
2,9,"When Viṣṇu and Śiva heard the entreaties of the gods, they knit their brows in fury and contorted their faces,"
2,10,"whereupon a great radiance came forth from Viṣṇu’s rage- filled countenance, and so, too, from Brahmā’s and Śiva’s."
2,11,"And from Indra’s body and from the bodies of all the other gods, a very great light issued, and it united and became one."
2,12,"The gods saw before them a peak of light like a mountain, blazing brightly and pervading the sky in every direction with its flames."
2,13,"Unequaled light, born from the bodies of all the gods, coalesced into a female form and pervaded the three worlds with its splendor."
2,14,"From Śiva’s light came that which formed the Devī’s face. Yama’s radiance formed Her hair, and Viṣṇu’s effulgence became Her arms."
2,15,"The moon god’s soft light formed Her breasts, and Indra’s brilliance became Her waist. Varuṇa’s light became Her legs, and earth’s splendor formed Her hips."
2,16,"Her feet took shape from Brahmā’s light and Her toes from Sürya’s brilliance. From the Vasus’ light Her fingers formed and from Kubera’s light, Her nose."
2,17,"From Prajāpati’s lustre came Her teeth, and from Agni’s radiance Her three eyes were born."
2,18,"Dawn and dusk became Her eyebrows, the wind god’s splendor shaped Her ears, and all else born of the other gods’ light shone too as the auspicious Devī."
2,19,"Then, beholding Her who appeared from out of their amassed light, all those gods, tormented by Mahiṣa, rejoiced."
2,20,"Then the gods bestowed on Her their own weapons and adornments. From his trident Śiva drew forth another and gave it to Her,"
2,21,"and Viṣṇu bestowed a discus spun out from his own. Varuṇa gave Her a conch; and Agni, the eater of oblations, gave Her a spear."
2,22,"Vāyu, the wind god, presented a bow and two quivers filled with arrows. Extracting a thunderbolt from his own, Indra, the lord of the immortals,"
2,23,"the all-seeing one, gave it to Her along with a bell from his elephant Airāvata. From his staff of death Yama produced another staff, and Varuṇa, the lord of waters, gave a noose."
2,24,"Brahmā, the lord of beings, gave prayer beads and an ascetic’s waterpot. Sūrya, the bringer of day, bestowed his rays of sunlight on all the pores of Her skin;"
2,25,"and Kāla, the lord of time, presented a sword and shining shield. The ocean of milk bestowed a necklace of flawless pearls, ever-new garments,"
2,26,"a celestial crest-jewel, earrings, and bracelets, a radiant crescent-shaped ornament, armlets for all Her arms,"
2,27,"a pair of shining anklets, a necklace beyond compare, and bejeweled rings for all Her fingers."
2,28,"Viśvakarman gave Her a gleaming ax, weapons of all kinds, and impenetrable armor."
2,29,"Garlands of unfading lotuses for Her head and breast the ocean gave to Her, and yet another magnificent lotus to grace Her hand."
2,30,"Himālaya, the lord of mountains, gave Her a lion to ride upon and jewels of many kinds; and Kubera, the lord of wealth, presented a drinking vessel ever-brimming with wine."
2,31,"Śeṣa, the lord of serpents, who supports this earth, gave Her a garland of snakes, adorned with precious gems."
2,32,"Honored also by the other gods with adornments and weapons, the Devī laughed thunderously and defiantly again and again."
2,33,"She filled the entire sky with Her terrible roar, and from the immeasurable din a great echo resounded."
2,34,"All the worlds shook, and the oceans churned. The earth quaked, and the mountains heaved."
2,35,"In joy the gods exclaimed, ‘Victory! ’ to the lion-mounted Devī; and with bodies bowed in devotion, the sages praised Her."
2,36,"When the enemies of the gods saw the three worlds in upheaval, they readied all their forces for battle and rose up as one, with weapons held high."
2,37,"‘Aha! What is this?’ Mahiṣāsura bellowed in wrath. Surrounded by countless asuras, he rushed toward the sound"
2,38,"and then beheld the Devī, who pervaded the three worlds with Her radiance, bending the earth under Her tread, scraping the sky with Her diadem,"
2,39,"shaking all the nether regions with the resonance of Her bowstring, and standing there, penetrating every direction with Her thousand arms."
2,40,"Thereupon, the battle began between the Devī and the enemies of the gods. Swords and missiles, hurled in every direction, lit up the quarters of the sky."
2,41,"Mahiṣāsura’s general, the great asura named Cikṣura, battled there, and Cāmara led cavalry, charioteers, elephant-drivers, and foot soldiers."
2,42,"The great asura called Udagra commanded sixty thousand chariots, Mahāhanu gave battle with his ten million,"
2,43,and the mighty Asiloman fought with forces fifty million strong. With sixty million Bāṣkala fought in the conflict.
2,44,"Encircled by streaming multitudes of elephants and horses, Parivārita fought in that battle with ten million chariots,"
2,45,"and he who is called Biḍāla, with five billion chariots surrounding him, engaged in combat there."
2,46,"Amid chariots, elephants, and horses, myriads of other great asuras battled with the Devī,"
2,47,"their countless chariots, elephants, and horses surrounding Māhiṣāsura there in the fray."
2,48,"With lances and javelins, spears and clubs, swords and axes, and sharp-edged spears, they fought with the Devī."
2,49,"Some hurled spears while others threw nooses; intent on killing Her, they began an assault with their swords."
2,50,"But She, the Devī Caṇḍikā, showered down all manner of weapons and cut through their armaments as if in play."
2,51,"Praised by gods and seers, She remained serene, even while unleashing Her weapons at the asuras’ bodies."
2,52,"Her lion-mount, shaking its mane in fury, stalked among the demon throngs as fire rages through a Forest."
2,53,The sighs that Ambikā heaved while fighting became at once Her legions by the hundreds and thousands.
2,54,"They fought with axes, javelins, swords, and sharp- edged spears, and drawing strength from Her power, they destroyed the demon hordes."
2,55,"Some of Her throngs beat war drums resoundingly, some blew conches, and others drummed upon tabors in their zest for battle."
2,56,"Then the Devī, with Her trident, club, and volleys of spears, with Her swords and other weapons, slew great asuras by the hundreds"
2,57,"and brought down still more with the confounding din of Her bell. Binding other asuras with Her noose, She dragged them along the ground."
2,58,"Her swordstrokes slashed others in two, while crushing blows from Her mace brought still more down,"
2,59,"and those bludgeoned by Her club vomited forth blood. Others fell to the ground, pierced through the chest by Her trident."
2,60,"Her steady stream of arrows made some on that battlefield resemble bristling porcupines, and those tormenters of the gods breathed their last."
2,61,"Some had their arms severed, others their necks broken. The heads of others rolled, and still others had their bodies ripped apart."
2,62,"Great asuras, their legs cut from under them, toppled to the ground. Some, severed lengthwise by the Devī, were left one-armed, one-eyed, one-legged."
2,63,"While others there in the battle danced to the throbbing drums, those that She decapitated fell and rose again,"
2,64,"headless bodies, still grasping swords, spears, and lances in hand. ‘Stop! Stop!’ other great asuras cried out to the Devī."
2,65,"Where that great battle raged, the earth was impassable with fallen chariots, elephants, horses, and corpses."
2,66,"Torrents of blood, like mighty rivers, gushed from elephants, asuras, and horses there in the midst of the demon army."
2,67,"In an instant, Ambikā led that vast legion of foes to its destruction, as quickly as fire consumes a heap of straw and wood."
2,68,"And Her lion, roaring thunderously and shaking its mane, prowled about in search of life- breath still issuing from the enemies’ bodies."
2,69,So did the Devī’s hosts wage war against the asuras. So also did the gods in heaven shower down flowers in praise.”
3,1,The seer said:
3,2,"“Now when he saw the army being slaughtered, Cikṣura, the great asura general, went forth in fury to battle with Ambikā."
3,3,"He rained showers of arrows on the Devī in the combat, just as a raincloud showers the summit of Mount Meru."
3,4,"But easily shattering his volley, the Devī killed his steeds and charioteer with Her arrows."
3,5,"Like lightning, She slashed through his bow and highflying banner. Having destroyed his bow, She wounded him in the limbs with Her swift arrows."
3,6,"With bow broken, chariot wrecked, and horses and charioteer slain, the asura, armed with sword and shield, rushed at the Devī."
3,7,"First striking Her lion on the head with his sharp-edged sword, he violently struck the Devī’s left arm."
3,8,"O king, as soon as the sword touched Her, it shattered. Then, the great asura, his eyes red with rage, seized his blazing lance"
3,9,"and flung it at Bhadrakālī, as though he were hurling the very sun from the sky."
3,10,"Seeing it approach, the Devī released Her lance and shattered the great asura and his weapon into a hundred pieces."
3,11,"When Mahiṣa’s mighty general lay slain, Cāmara, the afflictor of the gods, advanced, mounted on an elephant."
3,12,He dispatched his spear toward the Devī. Quickly Ambikā’s contemptuous outcry sent it hurtling powerless to the ground.
3,13,"Seeing it fallen and shattered, the enraged Cāmara flung a lance, and that, too, She destroyed with Her arrows."
3,14,"Her lion then leapt up and, astride the elephant’s forehead, engaged fiercely in direct combat with the enemy of the gods."
3,15,"Struggling, the two fell from the elephant to the ground, still locked in dreadful combat."
3,16,"In a flash the lion sprang skyward, then alighted and severed Cāmara’s head with a single blow of its paw."
3,17,"In the fighting the Devī assailed the asura Udagra with rocks and trees; and biting, punching, and slapping Karāla, She felled him, too."
3,18,"Enraged, the Devī crushed Uddhata to a pulp with the blows of Her mace. She killed Bāṣkala with Her javelin and Tāmra and Andhaka with Her arrows,"
3,19,"and with Her trident the supreme three-eyed Goddess slew Ugrāsya, Ugravīrya, and also Mahāhanu."
3,20,"With Her sword She struck Biḍāla’s head from his body, and with Her arrows She dispatched both Durdhara and Durmukha to the abode of death."
3,21,"While his army thus met destruction, Mahiṣāsura terrified the Devī’s hosts with his own buffalo form,"
3,22,jostling some with his snout and pawing others with his hooves. Others he lashed with his tail and lacerated with his horns.
3,23,"He toppled some of them to the ground with the unleashed force of his bellowing and wheeling about, and the blast of his breath brought still others down."
3,24,"After destroying the great Goddess’s forces, Mahiṣāsura rushed forward to slay Her lion. At that, Ambikā became enraged."
3,25,"But Mahiṣāsura, great in valor, struck the earth angrily with his hooves, flung mountains skyward with his horns, and bellowed frightfully."
3,26,"Under his frenzied wheeling, the trampled earth broke apart. Lashed by his tail, the ocean overflowed all around."
3,27,"Thrashed by his horns, the clouds fragmented and dispersed. Tossed about on his blasting breath, mountains by the hundreds fell from the sky."
3,28,"When She saw the great asura approaching, inflated with rage, Caṇḍikā aroused Her wrath and prepared to slay him."
3,29,"She threw Her noose over him and bound him. Fettered thus in the fierce battle, the great asura left his buffalo form"
3,30,and assumed the shape of a lion. No sooner had Ambikā severed his head than he appeared as a man with sword in hand.
3,31,"Instantly, with Her arrows the Devī cut him to shreds along with his sword and shield. Then he took the form of a great elephant"
3,32,"and dragged Her mighty lion along with his trunk, but while he trumpeted loudly, the Devī chopped off his trunk with Her sword."
3,33,"Once more the great asura assumed his buffalo form and caused the three worlds, with all that is moving and unmoving, to tremble."
3,34,"Angered, Caṇḍikā, the Mother of the worlds, drank a divine potion, and with eyes reddened She laughed again and again."
3,35,"The asura bellowed in return, intoxicated with his own might and valor, and with his horns he hurled mountains at Caṇḍikā."
3,36,"Her volley of arrows reduced them to dust. Her face flushed with inebriation from the divine drink, and She addressed him excitedly."
3,37,The Devī said:
3,38,"‘Bellow, you fool, bellow for now while I drink this potion. After I have slain you, the gods will cheer in this very place.”’"
3,39,The seer said:
3,40,"“Having declared that, She leapt upon the great asura, pinned his neck down with Her foot, and pierced him through with Her spear."
3,41,"Trapped there under the Devī’s foot and crushed by Her might, he emerged half-way in his true form from his buffalo mouth."
3,42,"Half-revealed and fighting still, that great asura fell to the Devī, beheaded by Her great sword."
3,43,"Then crying out in alarm, the whole demon army perished, and all the divine hosts exulted."
3,44,"Together with the great heavenly seers the gods praised the Devī, the celestial musicians sang, and throngs of cloud-nymphs danced.”"
4,1,The seer said:
4,2,"“When the Devī had struck down the brave but wicked Mahiṣāsura and his army of the Gods’ foes, Indra and the hosts of Gods lifted their voices to Her in praise, their heads bowed in reverence, their bodies made beautiful by the thrill of rapture."
4,3,"‘To the Devī, Who spreads out this world through Her own power and Who embodies Herself as all the powers of the hosts of Gods; to Ambikā, Who is worthy of"
4,4,"May She whose unequalled might and splendor even the blessed Viṣṇu, Brahmā, and Śiva are powerless to describe, may She, Caṇḍikā, be intent on protecting all the world and on destroying the fear of misfortune."
4,5,"O Devī, we bow before You Who are yourself good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous and misfortune in the abodes of the wicked, intelligence in the hearts of the learned, faith in the hearts of the good, and modesty in the hearts of the high-born. May You protect the universe!"
4,6,"How can we describe this form of yours, which surpasses thought? And Your abundant, exceeding valor that destroys evil? And Your deeds in battle, O Devī, among all the throngs of Gods and demons?"
4,7,You are the cause of all the worlds. Though containing the triple forces of
4,8,"O Devī, You are the mantra of consecration whose utterance in all sacrifices brings satisfaction to the whole assemblage of Gods, and You are the mantra which humans proclaim as the cause of satisfaction to the hosts of ancestral spirits."
4,9,"O Devī, Who are the cause of liberation and great, inconceivable austerities: sages yearning for liberation contemplate You with senses restrained, intent upon truth, with all faults cast off, for You are the blessed, supreme knowledge."
4,10,"With sound as Your essence, You are the treasury that holds the taintless Vedic hymns, sung to resound joyfully with Your holy name. You are the blessed Devī, Who embodies the three Vedas. Intent on conferring well-being, You are the supreme destroyer of pain in all the worlds."
4,11,"O Devī, You are the intelligence by which the essence of all scriptures is understood. You are Durgā, the vessel free of attachments that takes one across life’s difficult ocean. You are Srī, the radiant splendor that abides in the heart of Viṣṇu. You are Gaurī, the shining goddess Who abides with the moon-crowned Śiva."
4,12,"Gently smiling, Your shining face resembles the full moon’s orb and is as pleasing as the lustre of the finest gold. Beholding It, how could Mahiṣāsura, even though enraged, be moved to strike it?"
4,13,"Still stranger was it, O Devī, that Mahiṣa did not perish the instant he beheld Your wrathful face, reddened like the rising moon and scowling frightfully. For who can behold the enraged face of death and still live?"
4,14,"O Devī, Who are supreme, be gracious to all creation, for when angered You can annihilate multitudes. We saw this the moment You brought Mahiṣāsura’s vast power to an end."
4,15,"Those to whom You are bounteous are honored among peoples, theirs are riches, theirs are glories, and their righteous acts know no limit. They indeed are blessed with devoted children, attendants, and wives."
4,16,"One who is virtuous and ever mindful performs daily all righteous deeds, O Devī, and by Your grace attains to heaven. Are You not, then, the giver of rewards in all the three worlds?"
4,17,"Remembered in distress, You remove fear from every creature. Remembered by the untroubled, You confer even greater serenity of mind. Dispeller of poverty, suffering, and fear, Who other than You is ever intent on benevolence toward all?"
4,18,"The world attains happiness when You slay its foes, and though they may have committed enough evil to keep them long in torment, even as You strike down our enemies, O Devī, You think, May they reach heaven through death in battle with Me."
4,19,"Why does Your mere glance not reduce all asuras to ashes? Because when assailed by Your weapons and thus purified, even those adversaries may attain the higher worlds."
4,20,"If the intense light flashing frightfully from Your sword or the glaring brilliance of Your spearpoint did not blind the asuras’ eyes, it was because You made them behold the moonlike radiance beaming from Your face."
4,21,"Even toward them Your intentions are most gracious. O Devī, Your nature is to subdue the misconduct of the wicked. Others cannot equal Your inconceivable grace, for even while Your might destroys those Who have wrested power from the Gods, You show compassion toward those very foes."
4,22,"To what may Your prowess be compared? Where else is there beauty so ravishing, yet striking fear into enemies? Where in the three worlds are compassion in heart and resolve in battle seen as they are in You, O beneficent Devī?"
4,23,"Destroying all foes, You have saved the three worlds. Slaying them at the battle-front, You led even those frenzied, hostile throngs to heaven, even while dispelling our fear of them. Salutations to You!"
4,24,"Protect us with Your spear, O Devī, and protect us with Your sword, O Ambikā. Protect us with the clangor of Your bell and the resonance of Your bowstring."
4,25,"Guard us in the east and in the west, O Caṇḍikā. Guard us in the south and also in the north, O Īśvarī, by brandishing Your spear."
4,26,"With Your gentle forms that move through the three worlds and with Your surpassingly terrible ones, protect us and also the earth."
4,27,"O Ambikā, with sword, spear, mace, and whatever other weapons Your tender hands have touched, protect us on all sides.’”"
4,28,The seer said:
4,29,"“In that way the Gods praised Her Who supports the worlds, honoring Her with flowers that bloom in Indra’s paradise and anointing Her with perfumes."
4,30,"Devotedly the assembled Gods offered heavenly incense to Her. Serene of countenance, She spoke to all the Gods, who were bowed down in reverence."
4,31,The Devī said:
4,32,"‘All You Gods, ask whatever You wish of Me. Well pleased with Your hymns, I will gladly grant it.’"
4,33,The Gods said:
4,34,"‘Since You, the glorious one, have slain our enemy, this Mahiṣāsura, all has been accomplished; nothing remains to be done."
4,35,"But if You are to grant a blessing, O great sovereign, may You destroy our direst misfortunes whenever we remember You."
4,36,"O You of spotless countenance, may You bring increased wealth, family, and success to whatever mortal shall praise You with these hymns."
4,37,"Through Your power of abundance, O Ambikā, be ever gracious unto us!”’"
4,38,The seer said:
4,39,"“O king, thus propitiated by the Gods for the world’s sake and for their own, Bhadrakālī said, ‘So let it be,’ and vanished from sight."
4,40,"So is it told, O king, how She came forth long ago from the bodies of the Gods, the Devī Who desires the wellbeing of the three worlds."
4,41,"I shall relate further how, for the destruction of Śumbha and Niśumbha and other wicked daityas, She appeared from the body of Gaurī,"
4,42,"the benefactor of the Gods, for the protection of the three worlds. Hear me tell it. I shall relate it to you as it happened.”"
5,1,OṀ klīm. The seer said:
5,2,"“Long ago, grown arrogant with power, the asuras Śumbha and Niśumbha seized Indra’s sovereignty over the three worlds and his share of the sacrifices."
5,3,"In like manner they usurped the authority of the sun and the moon, and that of Kubera, Yama, and Varuṇa—the lords of wealth, death, and the ocean."
5,4,"They seized the wind god’s power and Agni’s functions. The gods were defeated, deposed, and driven out."
5,5,"Stripped of their powers and cast out by those two great asuras, all the gods remembered the invincible Devī."
5,6,"‘She granted us a boon, saying, “Whenever you remember Me in times of distress, from that very moment I will put an end to all your worst calamities.’”"
5,7,"With that in mind, the gods went to Himālaya, the lord of mountains, and there praised the Devī, Who is Viṣṇumāyā."
5,8,The gods said:
5,9,"‘Salutation to the Devī, to the great Devī. Salutation always to Her Who is auspicious. Salutation to Her Who is the primordial cause, to Her Who is gracious. With minds intent, we bow down to Her."
5,10,"Salutation to Her Who is terrible. To Gaurī, the eternal, shining one; to Her Who sustains the universe, salutations again and again. Salutation always to Her Who is moonlight, Who has the form of the moon and is blissful."
5,11,"We bow to Her Who is auspicious beauty. We make salutations again and again to Her Who is prosperity and attainment. Salutations again and again to Her Who is the fortune and misfortune of kings, to Śarvāṇī, the consort of Śiva."
5,12,"Salutation always to Durgā, Who takes us through difficulties, Who is the Creator and indwelling essence of all, Who is right knowledge, and Who also appears dark as smoke."
5,13,"We bow down to Her Who is at once most gentle and most fierce. Salutations to Her again and again. Salutation to the support of the world. To the Devī, Who is creative action, salutations again and again."
5,14-16,"To the Devī, Who in all beings is called Viṣṇumāyā, salutation to Her, salutation to Her, salutation to Her again and again."
5,17-19,"To the Devī, Who in all beings is seen as consciousness, salutation to Her, salutation to Her, salutation to Her again and again."

5,71-73,"To the Devī, Who abides in all beings in the form of mother, salutation to Her, salutation to Her, salutation to Her again and again."
5,74-76,"To the Devī, Who abides in all beings in the form of error, salutation to Her, salutation to Her, salutation to Her again and again."
5,77,"To Her Who presides over the elements and the senses, and is ever present in all beings, to the all-pervading Devī, salutations again and again."
5,78-80,"To Her Who pervades this entire world and abides in the form of consciousness, salutation to Her, salutation to Her, salutation to Her again and again."
5,81,"Praised long ago by the gods for fulfilling their desires and likewise honored daily by the lord of the gods, may Īśvarī, the source of all good, create happiness and prosperity for us, and may She destroy our misfortunes."
5,82,"Tormented by arrogant daityas, we gods now honor Her, the supreme power. With bodies bowed down in devotion, at this moment we remember Her Who destroys all afflictions.’”"
5,83,The seer said:
5,84,"“O king, while the gods were thus engaged in praise and adoration, Pārvatī came to bathe in the waters of the Gaṇgā."
5,85,"She Who is fair of countenance asked the gods, ‘Whom are you praising?’ From Her own body an auspicious form emerged and replied:"
5,86,"‘This hymn is an appeal to Me by those whom the daitya Śumbha cast out, by the assembled gods whom Niśumbha defeated in battle.’"
5,87,"And since Ambikā came forth from Pārvatī’s bodily form, She is glorified in all the worlds as Kauśikī."
5,88,"Thereupon, Pārvatī became black. Thus known as Kālīkā, She makes Her abode in the Himālayas."
5,89,"Then Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, two servants of Śumbha and Niśumbha, beheld Ambikā’s captivating beauty."
5,90,"And they told Śumbha, ‘O great king, an unknown woman, surpassingly beautiful, dwells illuminating the Himālayas."
5,91,"Nowhere has anyone ever seen such supreme beauty. May you learn Who that goddess is and take possession of Her, O lord of asuras!"
5,92,"She abides there, a jewel among Women, fairest of limb, casting Her radiance in all directions. O chief of daityas, surely you must behold Her!"
5,93,"Master, whatever gems and jewels, elephants, horses, and other riches exist in the three worlds, all those now enhance your dwelling."
5,94,"From Indra you have taken Airāvata, the jewel among elephants, and also the celestial coral tree and the horse Uccaiḥśravas."
5,95,"Taken from Brahmā, this wondrous jewel among chariots, yoked with swans, stands here in your courtyard."
5,96,"Seized from Kubera, the lord of wealth, is his treasure. And the lord of the ocean has relinquished his garland of unfading lotuses."
5,97,"Varuṇa’s umbrella, which showers down gold, now stands in your house along with this best of chariots, which once was Prajāpati’s."
5,98,"Master, you have taken Yama’s spear, which grants departure from this life. Varuṇa’s noose is among your brother’s possessions."
5,99,"To Niśumbha belong all manner of gems born of the sea. And to the two of you, Agni has given garments purified by his own fire."
5,100,"Thus, O chief of daityas, you have appropriated all things of value. Why then do you not seize this jewel among Women for yourself?’”"
5,101,The seer said:
5,102,"“On hearing these words of Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, Śumbha sent the great asura Sugrīva as a messenger to the Devī."
5,103,"Instructing him, he said: ‘Go to Her and speak such words on my behalf that She will be delighted and will quickly come to me.’"
5,104,"Sugrīva went there to the resplendent, craggy place where the Devī dwelt and spoke honeyed words to Her in unctuous tones."
5,105,The messenger said:
5,106,"‘O Devī, in the three worlds Śumbha, the lord of daityas, is the supreme sovereign. I am his messenger. I have come here to your presence, sent by him"
5,107,Who has conquered all the enemies of the daityas and whose command is never resisted in the dwellings of the gods. Hear what he says:
5,108,"“All the three worlds are mine, and the gods submit to my will. I enjoy each one’s share of the sacrifices, every one of them."
5,109,"Indeed I possess all the finest gems in the three worlds, and I have taken Airāvata, the jewel among elephants and Indra’s mount."
5,110,"The immortal gods, bowed down in reverence, offered me Uccaihśravas, the jewel among horses, born from the churning of the milk ocean."
5,111,"And whatever else is precious among the gods and celestial beings, all that is mine, O fair one."
5,112,"We think of you, O Goddess, as the jewel among Women in the world, which indeed You are. Come to us, for we take pleasure in all the finest things."
5,113,"Choose either me or my valiant younger brother, Niśumbha, for with Your flashing eyes You are truly a jewel."
5,114,"By taking me you will obtain dominion beyond compare. With reasoning mind, consider this well and become my wife.’””"
5,115,The seer said:
5,116,"“Thus addressed, the Devī smiled inscrutably. The blessed, auspicious Durgā, Who supports the universe, spoke."
5,117,The Devī said:
5,118,"‘You have spoken the truth; there is nothing false in what you have said. Śumbha is the ruler of the three worlds, and so also is Niśumbha."
5,119,But how can I go back on My word? Hear of the vow I once made out of foolishness:
5,120,"He alone Who conquers Me in battle, Who removes My pride, Who equals My strength in the world, will become My husband."
5,121,"Therefore let Śumbha or the great asura Niśumbha come here. Why delay? Having conquered Me, let him take my hand in marriage.’"
5,122,The messenger said:
5,123,"‘You are arrogant, O Devī. Speak not so in my presence. What man in the three worlds surpasses Śumbha and Niśumbha?"
5,124,"Even against the other daityas, all the gods cannot stand face to face in battle, O Devī. How then can You, Who are one Woman alone?"
5,125,"Indra and all the other gods could not resist Śumbha and the other demons in battle. How will You, a woman, go forth and confront them?"
5,126,"As I have said, go to Śumbha and Niśumbha’s side. Suffer not the indignity of being dragged there by your hair.’"
5,127,The Devī said:
5,128,"‘So must it be. Śumbha is mighty and Niśumbha is exceedingly heroic, but what can I do? My rash vow was made long ago."
5,129,Go back and tell the chief of asuras exactly what I have said. And let him do what is fitting.’”
6,1,The seer said:
6,2,"“On hearing the Devī’s words, the messenger was filled with indignation. He returned to the king of the daityas and related everything in great detail."
6,3,"On hearing his messenger’s report, the asura king grew enraged and said to Dhūmralocana, the chieftain of the daityas:"
6,4,"‘Dhūmralocana, hasten with your army and bring that vile woman here by force, dragging her by the hair, kicking and screaming."
6,5,"If anyone rises up to save her, even a god or other celestial being, he is to be slain.’”"
6,6,The seer said:
6,7,"“Commanded thus by Śumbha, the daitya Dhūmralocana quickly set off, accompanied by sixty thousand asuras."
6,8,"And when he saw the Devī stationed on the snowy mountain, he thundered, ‘Come to the presence of Śumbha and Niśumbha."
6,9,"And if Her highness will not come in gladness to my master now, then I will take Her by force, dragging Her by the hair, kicking and screaming.’"
6,10,The Devī said:
6,11,"‘You who are sent by the lord of the daityas are mighty yourself and accompanied by your army. If you take me by force, what can I do to you?’”"
6,12,The seer said:
6,13,"“Thus addressed, the asura Dhūmralocana rushed at Her. Thereupon, with a contemptuous outcry, Ambikā reduced him to ashes."
6,14,"The great army of asuras, now provoked, rained sharp arrows, spears, and axes upon Ambikā."
6,15,"Then the lion, the Devī’s mount, angrily shook its mane. Emitting a terrifying roar, it fell upon the demon army."
6,16,"With blows of its paws, it slew some daityas and crushed others in its jaws. And it trampled other great asuras under its hind legs."
6,17,"With its claws, the lion tore into the entrails of some and beheaded others with the stroke of a paw."
6,18,"It tore the arms and heads off others still, and tossing its mane, it lapped up the blood from the bellies of others."
6,19,"In an instant that noble, infuriated lion which bore the Devī wreaked destruction on all that army."
6,20,"When he heard that the Devī had slain the asura Dhūmralocana and that Her lion had destroyed his entire army,"
6,21,"Śumbha, the king of daityas, shook with rage. His lower lip quivering, he commanded the two great asuras, Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa:"
6,22,"‘Caṇḍa! Muṇḍa! Go there with immense forces, and bring Her here at once,"
6,23,"seizing Her by the hair or tying Her up. But if you hesitate to do this, then let all the asuras with all their weapons strike Her down in battle."
6,24,"When that vile Woman has been wounded and Her lion slain, seize Her, bind Her, and bring Her here without delay!”’"
7,1,The seer said:
7,2,"“Headed by Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, the daityas’ fourfold army of elephants, charioteers, cavalry, and infantry went forth at Śumbha’s command, brandishing weapons."
7,3,"They saw The Devī Smiling Gently, Seated Upon Her Lion Atop the great, golden peak of the highest mountain."
7,4,"Seeing Her, they contrived to Carry Her Off. While some approached with swords drawn and bows poised in readiness,"
7,5,"Ambikā cried out angrily against those foes, and In Wrath Her Face Turned As Black As Ink."
7,6,"From Her Scowling Brow, Kālī Sprang Forth, Frightful Of Countenance And Armed With Sword And Noose,"
7,7,"Bearing A Strange Skull-Topped Staff, Adorned With A Garland Of Skulls, And Clad In A Tiger’s Skin. Her Emaciated Flesh Appalling,"
7,8,"Her Mouth Gaping, Her Lolling Tongue Horrifying, Her Sunken Eyes Glowing red, She Filled the four quarters of the sky With Her Roars."
7,9,"Swiftly Falling Upon the great asuras in that army, She Slew And Devoured Those hosts of the Gods’ foes."
7,10,"Attacking the rear guard and Seizing the elephants with their drivers, warriors, and bells, She Flung them Into Her Mouth With A Single Hand."
7,11,"In like Manner, She Tossed the cavalry with its horses and the charioteers with their chariots Into Her Mouth and Ground them Furiously Between Her Teeth."
7,12,"She Seized one asura by the hair and another by the throat. Crushing another Underfoot, She Slammed yet another Against Her breast."
7,13,The weapons and great missiles the asuras hurled She Caught In Her Mouth and Ground Angrily Between Her Teeth.
7,14,"All that army of mighty and evil-natured asuras She Ravaged, Devouring some and Beating others Severely."
7,15,She Struck Down some With Her Sword and Battered others with Her Skull-Topped Staff. Other asuras met their destruction Between Her Gnashing Teeth.
7,16,"When Caṇḍa saw the entire army of asuras swiftly struck down, he rushed at The Terrifying Kālī."
7,17,"With a formidable deluge of arrows, that great asura engulfed The Glowering Kālī while Muṇḍa hurled discuses at Her by the thousands,"
7,18,myriad discuses That Entered Her Mouth as so many solar orbs vanishing into the denseness of a cloud.
7,19,"With A Terrifying Roar, Kālī Laughed In Fury, Her Fearsome Teeth Gleaming Within Her Ghastly Mouth."
7,20,"Mounting Her Great Lion, The Devī Rushed at Caṇḍa, seized him by the hair, and Severed his head With Her Sword."
7,21,"Seeing Caṇḍa slain, Muṇḍa attacked Her. She Pushed him to the ground and Struck him In Fury With Her Sword."
7,22,"Seeing Caṇḍa and also the most valorous Muṇḍa slain, the remaining army panicked and fled in all directions."
7,23,"And Kālī, Grasping the heads of Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, Approached Caṇḍikā. Mingling Fierce, Loud Laughter With Her Words, She Said:"
7,24,‘I Here Present To You Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa As Two Great Offerings in the sacrifice of battle. You Yourself Shall Slay Śumbha and Niśumbha.’”
7,25,The seer said:
7,26,"“When She Saw Those two great asuras, Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, Brought Before Her, The Auspicious Caṇḍikā Spoke These Playful Words To Kālī:"
7,27,"‘Because You Have Overpowered Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa And Delivered Them To Me, You, O Devī, Will Henceforth Be Known In The World As Cāmuṇḍā.’”"
8,1,The seer said
8,2,"“After Caṇḍa was killed, Muṇḍa slain, and the vast armies annihilated, the lord of asuras"
8,3,"burned with rage. His reason overcome, Śumbha ordered the marshaling of all the demon hosts:"
8,4,"‘Now let the daitya clans with all their troops go forth, the eighty-six Udāyudha and the eighty-four Kambu families, together with their forces."
8,5,Let the fifty Koṭivīrya families and the hundred Dhaumra clans depart at my command
8,6,"So also at my command, let the Kālaka, Daurhṛda, Maurya, and Kālakeya asuras set out in haste, armed for battle.’"
8,7,"Having issued his orders, Śumbha, the despotic lord of asuras, went forth, attended by many thousands of mighty troops."
8,8,"Seeing that most formidable army approach, Caṇḍikā filled the space between earth and sky with the resonance of Her bowstring"
8,9,"Thereupon her lion emitted a deafening roar, O king, and Ambikā heightened the noise with Her clanging bell."
8,10,"Kālī drowned out the din of bowstring, lion, and bell, filling every direction with terrifying howls from Her gaping mouth."
8,11,"Hearing the tumult, the enraged demon armies closed in on the Devī, her lion, and Kālī from all four sides."
8,12,"O king, at that very moment, to insure the well-being of the supreme gods and to annihilate their adversaries, surpassingly brave and powerful"
8,13,"śaktis, the gods’ embodied powers, sprang forth from the bodies of Brahmā, Śiva, Skanda, Viṣṇu, and Indra, mirroring the form of each. They approached Caṇḍikā."
8,14,"Whatever that god’s form was, whatever his adornments and his mount, in that very form his śakti went forth to combat the asuras."
8,15,"In a celestial chariot drawn by swans, Brahmā’s śakti came forth with prayer beads and waterpot in hand. She is called Brahmāṇī."
8,16,"Māheśvarī arrived astride a bull, holding the finest trident, wearing great serpents for bracelets, and adorned with the crescent moon."
8,17,"Ambikā, having the war god’s form and riding a fine peacock, came forth as Kaumārī with spear in hand to fight against the daityas."
8,18,"Likewise the śakti Vaiṣṇavī, mounted on Garuda, approached holding conch, discus, mace, bow, and sword."
8,19,"The śakti of Hari, who bears the unique form of the sacrificial boar, came forward as Vārāhī in that boarlike aspect."
8,20,"Nārasirhhī, resembling Viṣṇu’s embodiment as a man-lion, arrived there, scattering the constellations with the toss of Her mane."
8,21,"Thousand-eyed like Indra, and in like manner with thunderbolt in hand, Aindrī arrived riding on the lord of elephants."
8,22,"Then Śiva, surrounded by those śaktis of the gods, said to Caṇḍikā, ‘Let the asuras quickly be slain for My satisfaction.’"
8,23,"Thereupon from the Devī’s body there issued forth Caṇḍikā’s Own terrifying śakti, savage in her fury and howling like a hundred jackals."
8,24,"And She, the unvanquished one, said to Śiva of dark, matted locks, ‘Go, My lord, as My messenger to Śumbha and Niśumbha."
8,25,"Say to those two arrogant dānavas, Śumbha and Niśumbha, and to the other dānavas assembled there for battle:"
8,26,"“Indra must regain the three worlds, the gods must again enjoy the sacrificial oblations, and you must return to the nether world if you wish to live."
8,27,"But if through the conceit of strength you are desirous of battle, then come and let My jackals be satiated with your flesh!”’"
8,28,"Since the Devī appointed Śiva himself as messenger, she has come to be known in this world as Śivadūtī."
8,29,"Hearing Śiva declare the Devī’s words, the great asuras were filled with indignation and went to where Kātyāyanī stood."
8,30,"At the outbreak of battle, the gods’ adversaries, arrogant in their anger, rained torrents of arrows, spears, and lances upon the Devī."
8,31,"And She, with great arrows shot from Her resounding bow, playfully split asunder their hurtling arrows, lances, spears, and axes."
8,32,"Kālī roamed about the battlefront, slashing Her enemies to shreds with Her spear and crushing them with Her skull-topped staff"
8,33,"And Brahmāṇī, wherever She went, left Her enemies sapped of strength, disabled by the holy water sprinkled from Her waterpot."
8,34,"Māheśvarī slew the daityas with Her trident; so, too, did Vaiṣṇavī with Her discus, Kaumārī with Her spear, and the wrathful"
8,35,"Aindrī with Her thunderbolt. Daityas and dānavas, tom asunder, fell by the hundreds, discharging torrents of blood upon the earth."
8,36,"They fell, scattered by blows from Vārāhī’s boarlike snout, pierced through the chest by Her tusks, and ripped apart by Her discus."
8,37,"Nārasiṁhī, tearing other great asuras apart with Her claws and devouring them, roamed about the battlefield, filling the sky with Her roars."
8,38,"Dazed by Śivadūtī’s violent laughter, the asuras fell to the ground, and She devoured those fallen ones."
8,39,"When the enemy troops saw the enraged band of Mothers crushing the mighty asuras by diverse means, they fled."
8,40,"Seeing the remaining daityas flee, tormented thus by the band of Mothers, the great asura Raktabīja went forth in anger to do battle."
8,41,"Whenever a drop of blood fell from his body to the ground, an asura of like measure would rise up from the earth."
8,42,With club in hand the great asura fought with Indra’s śakti. Then Aindrī struck Raktabīja with Her thunderbolt.
8,43,"Blood streamed in torrents from the stricken asura, and from that blood rose up warriors of identical form and might."
8,44,"As many drops of blood fell from his body, so many beings of equal valor, strength, and courage arose,"
8,45,"and those who sprang up from his blood battled there with the Mothers ever more fiercely, hurling the most formidable of weapons."
8,46,"When the Devī’s thunderbolt struck Raktabīja’s head, blood flowed again, and from it asuras were born by the thousands"
8,47,"In the combat Vaiṣṇavī attacked the lord of asuras with Her discus, and Aindri beat him with Her mace."
8,48,"Blood flowed from the cuts of Vaiṣṇavī’s discus, and there from great asuras of equal measure arose by the thousands and filled the world."
8,49,"Kaumārī with her spear, Vārāhī with her sword, and Māheśvarī with her trident struck the great asura Raktabīja,"
8,50,"and he, the mighty, rage-filled daitya, struck all the Mothers one by one with his club."
8,51,"Out of the blood that streamed upon the earth from the relentless wounds of spear, lance, and other weapons, asuras sprang up by the hundreds,"
8,52,and those demons born from this one demon’s flowing blood pervaded all the world. Utter terror seized the gods.
8,53,"Caṇḍikā burst into laughter at their despair and said to Kālī, ‘O Cāmuṇḍā, open wide your mouth"
8,54,and quickly drink in the drops of blood from my weapons’ blows and the great asuras born therefrom.
8,55,"Roam about on the battlefield and devour the great demons sprung from Raktabīja. So shall this daitya, drained of blood, go to his destruction."
8,56,"As you consume those fierce asuras, others shall not arise.’ Having spoken thus, the Devī attacked Raktabīja with her lance,"
8,57,"while Kālī avidly lapped up his blood. Raktabīja turned upon Caṇḍikā with his club,"
8,58,but his cudgel blows caused Her not even the slightest pain. From his beaten body blood flowed copiously
8,59,"in every direction, and Cāmuṇḍā engulfed it with Her mouth. And within Her mouth those great asuras who sprang into being from the flow,"
8,60,"those She now devoured, even while drinking Raktabīja’s blood."
8,61,"The Devī assailed Raktabīja with lance, thunderbolt, arrows, swords, and spears while Cāmuṇḍā drank his blood."
8,62,"O king, battered by that array of weapons and drained of blood, the great asura Raktabīja toppled to the ground."
8,63,"The gods attained immeasurable joy, O king, and the band of Mothers born from them danced about, intoxicated with blood.”"
9,1,The king said:
9,2,"“Wonderful is this, revered sir, that you have told me about the Devī’s glorious deed in slaying Raktabīja."
9,3,I wish to hear more about what Śumbha and the wrathful Niśumbha did after Raktabīja was killed.”
9,4,The seer said:
9,5,"“After Raktabīja was killed and the others slain in battle, Śumbha and Niśumbha fell into unparalleled rage."
9,6,"Seeing that his mighty army was being slaughtered, Niśumba was overcome with fury and rushed forward with the best of his demon forces."
9,7,"In front of him, behind him, and on both sides, great asuras, their lips compressed in anger, advanced to slay the Devī."
9,8,"Having battled the Mothers, Śumbha, mighty in valor and surrounded by his forces, came forward in fury to attack the Devī."
9,9,"Fierce fighting erupted between them, and like two thunderclouds, Śumbha and Niśumbha rained down torrents of arrows on the Devī."
9,10,Caṇḍikā intercepted them with Her Own volley of arrows and struck the demon chiefs in the limbs with a stream of weapons.
9,11,"Niśumbha, seizing his sharpened spear and shining shield, struck the lion, the Devī’s magnificent mount, on the head."
9,12,"Her lion assaulted, the Devī swiftly cut through Niśumbha’s superb sword with Her razor-sharp arrow and through his shield, emblazoned with eight moons."
9,13,"His shield and sword broken, the asura hurled his spear, and as it came toward Her, that, too, the Devī cut in half with Her discus."
9,14,"Blustering with rage, the dānava Niśumbha seized his lance, and as it came flying, the Devī crushed it with a blow of Her fist."
9,15,"Then swinging his club, Niśumbha flung it at Caṇḍikā. The Devī’s trident reduced it to ashes."
9,16,"After wounding the onrushing demon chief with ax in hand, the Devī forced him to the ground with a volley of arrows."
9,17,"When he saw Niśumbha, his brother of fearsome strength, lying fallen on the ground, Śumbha moved forward, greatly enraged, to slay Ambikā."
9,18,"Standing in his chariot and holding aloft magnificent weapons, he shone forth and filled the entire sky with his eight incomparable arms"
9,19,"While She watched him approach, the Devī sounded Her conch, set off an unbearable reverberation with Her bowstring,"
9,20,"and filled the firmament with the ringing of Her bell, which sapped the strength of the assembled demon armies."
9,21,Then the lion filled every direction with great roars that caused even the elephants’ mighty prowess to falter.
9,22,"Kālī sprang skyward and alighted, pounding the earth with Her two hands. The noise drowned out all the previous sounds."
9,23,"Śivadūtī laughed loudly and menacingly. When the asuras grew terrified at the sounds, Śumbha flew into a monstrous rage."
9,24,"Ambikā cried out for him, that evil-natured one, to stop, and the gods cheered Her on to victory from their positions in the sky."
9,25,"But Śumbha approached and hurled a fearsome, flaming spear, an oncoming mass of fire that the Devī’s own firebrand warded off."
9,26,"Śumbha’s leonine roar pervaded the space between heaven, earth, and the netherworld, but the Devī’s violent thunderclap drowned it out, O king."
9,27,"The Devī split Śumbha’s flying arrows with sharp arrows of Her own, and likewise he split Hers, each discharging arrows by the hundreds and thousands."
9,28,"Then the enraged Caṇḍikā pierced Śumbha with Her lance. Wounded, he fainted and fell to the ground."
9,29,"Meanwhile Niśumbha, regaining consciousness, seized his bow and shot arrows at theDevī, Kālī, and the lion."
9,30,"And then, creating ten thousand arms for himself, the daitya chief, that son of Diti, engulfed Caṇḍikā with ten thousand discuses."
9,31,"Thus provoked, the glorious Durgā, who destroys adversity and afflictions, cut through his discuses and missiles with arrows of Her own."
9,32,"Niśumbha, surrounded by his demon army, swiftly seized his club and rushed at Caṇḍikā to kill Her."
9,33,"Instantly She split the onrushing Niśumbha’s club with Her keen-edged sword. He grasped his lance,"
9,34,"and as he approached with weapon in hand, Caṇḍikā pierced him, the afflictor of the gods, through the heart with a swiftly hurled spear."
9,35,"From his heart’s gaping wound came forth another mighty and valorous being, who shouted for the Devī to stop."
9,36,"Bursting into derisive laughter, She severed his head with Her sword, and the figure who had thus emerged fell to the ground."
9,37,"The lion then devoured the asuras whose necks it had crushed with its fearsome fangs, while Kālī and Śivadūtī devoured others."
9,38,"Great asuras perished, pierced through by Kaumārī’s spear; others shrank away from the water sanctified by Brahmāṇī’s mantras."
9,39,"Others fell, ripped open by Māheśvarī’s trident; some lay on the ground, smashed by the blows of Vārāhī’s snout."
9,40,"Dānavas were cut to pieces, some by Vaiṣṇavī’s discus and others by the thunderbolt discharged from Aindrī’s fingertips."
9,41,"Some asuras perished, some fled from the great battle, and others were devoured by Kālī, Śivadūtī, and the lion.”"
10,1,The seer said:
10,2,"“Seeing the lifeless body of Niśumbha, the brother who was as dear to him as life itself, and seeing his forces being slaughtered, the enraged Śumbha spoke these words:"
10,3,"‘O Durgā, who are corrupt with the arrogance of power, do not show your pride here, for though you are haughty, you fight depending on the strength of others.’"
10,4,The Devī said:
10,5,"‘I Am Alone Here in the world. Who else is there besides Me? Behold, O vile one! These are but Projections of My Own Power, now Entering Back into Me.’"
10,6,"Thereupon All Those Goddesses, Led By Brahmāṇī, Merged Into The Devī’s Body. Then Ambikā Alone Remained."
10,7,The Devī Said:
10,8,"‘I have Now Withdrawn the Many Forms I Inhabited Here, Projected by My power. I Stand Alone. Be resolute in combat.’”"
10,9,The seer said:
10,10,"“Then a horrific battle broke out between the two of them, the Devī and Śumbha, while all the Gods and asuras looked on."
10,11,"With showers of arrows, sharp weapons, and terrifying missiles, the two met again in a combat that frightened all the world."
10,12,"The Wondrous Weapons That Ambikā Now Unleashed by the hundreds, the daitya chief deflected with defensive strikes."
10,13,"And the magic missiles that he hurled, the Supreme Devī Shattered Playfully With Fierce Cries of Contempt."
10,14,"Then the asura covered Her with hundreds of arrows. Provoked, the Devī Discharged Her arrows and Split his bow."
10,15,"His bow broken, the daitya chief took up his spear, but even as it rested in his hand, the Devī Cut Through it With Her Discus."
10,16,"Then, grasping his sword, emblazoned with a hundred moons, the supreme lord of the daityas rushed at the Devī."
10,17,"As he advanced, Caṇḍikā Broke his sword with sharp Arrows shot from Her bow, and also his shield that shone as the sun’s rays."
10,18,"His steed slain, his bow broken, his chariot wrecked, the daitya grasped his fearsome mace, intent on destroying Ambikā."
10,19,"With sharp Arrows, She Shattered the onrushing Śumbha’s mace. Still, he rushed at Her with fist upraised."
10,20,"The daitya chief slammed his fist down on the Devī’s Heart, and She Struck him on the chest with Her Palm."
10,21,"Struck by that blow, the demon king fell to the ground. At once, he rose up again,"
10,22,"and springing upward, he seized the Devī and ascended high into the sky. There in midair Caṇḍikā Battled with him."
10,23,"In the sky, the daitya and Caṇḍikā fought hand to hand as never before, to the astonishment of saints and sages."
10,24,"And after prolonged combat, Ambikā Snatched him up, swung him around, and Flung him to the earth."
10,25,"Striking the ground, the evil one immediately raised his fist and ran forward, desirous of destroying Ambikā."
10,26,The Devī thrust Her Spear through his chest and Threw that onrushing lord of all demonic creatures to the ground.
10,27,"Pierced through by The Devī’s Weapon, his life-breath gone, he fell to the ground, shaking all the earth together with its oceans, islands, and mountains."
10,28,"When the evil one was slain, all the universe became calm, regaining its natural order, and the sky cleared."
10,29,"The flaming clouds of portent that formerly gathered now subsided, and rivers again flowed along their courses when Śumbha fell slain."
10,30,"All the hosts of Gods were overjoyed when he lay slain, and the celestial musicians sang sweetly."
10,31,"Others sounded their instruments, and throngs of heavenly nymphs danced. Favorable winds blew, and the sun shone in glory."
10,32,"The sacred fires glowed peacefully, and the sounds born of the four directions faded away.”"
11,1,The seer said:
11,2,"“After the Devī had slain the great asura chief, Indra and the other gods, led by Agni, praised Kātyāyanī for granting their wishes. With hopes fulfilled, their faces beamed."
11,3,"‘O Devī, Who remove the sufferings of those who take refuge in you, be gracious. Be Gracious, Mother of the entire world. Be Gracious, Ruler of All. Protect the universe, O Devī, Who are the Ruler of the Moving and The Unmoving."
11,4,"You Alone Are The Sustaining Power Of The World, for You Abide In The Form Of The Earth. By You, Who Exist In The Form Of Water, all this universe prospers, O Devī Of Unsurpassable Strength."
11,5,"Of Boundless Might, You Are Viṣṇu’s Power, The Source Of All, The Supreme Māyā. Deluded, O Devī, is all this universe. In this world, You Alone, When Pleased, Are The Cause Of Liberation."
11,6,"All Forms Of Knowledge Are Your Aspects, O Devī, as are All Women In The world. By You Alone, The Mother, Is This world filled. What praise can be sung to You Who Are Beyond Praise?"
11,7,"O Devī, Who Have Become All Things, Who Bestow Enjoyment And Liberation—when You are praised, what Words, however excellent, can extol You?"
11,8,"Salutation be To you, Devī Nārāyaṇī, Who Abide As Intelligence In The Hearts Of All Beings, Granting Heavenly Reward And Final Liberation."
11,9,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Bring Change As The Moments Of Ever-Passing Time, Who Are The Power At The Cessation of the universe."
11,10,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Are The Good Of All Good, The Auspicious One; To You Who Accomplish Every Intent; To You, The Refuge, The All-Knowing, Shining Gauri!"
11,11,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Are The Power Of Creation, Sustenance, And Destruction; Who Are Eternal; Who Are The Source And Embodiment Of The Threefold Energy."
11,12,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Are Intent On Rescuing the distressed and afflicted that take refuge in You; to Tou, O Devī, Who Temove the suffering of all."
11,13,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Assume The Form Of Brahmāṇl, Riding In A Swanyoked Chariot, O Devī, And Sprinkling sanctified water."
11,14,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Have The Form Of Māheśvarl, Bearing trident, moon, and serpent, and Riding a mighty bull."
11,15,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Have The Form Of Kaumāri, The Faultless One attended by peacock and cock, and Bearing A Great Spear."
11,16,"Salutation be To you, Nārāyaṇī, Who Have The Form Of Vaisṇavl, Holding The Supreme Weapons of conch, discus, mace, and bow. Be Gracious!"
11,17,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Auspicious One, Who Have Viṣṇu’s Boarlike Form, Grasping A Great, Formidable Discus and Uplifting The Earth With Your tusks."
11,18,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyanl, Who In The Ferocious Form Of The Man-Lion Are Intent On Killing the daityas and Protecting the three worlds."
11,19,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Are Adorned With Diadem, great thunderbolt, and Thousand-Eyed Radiance; to You, O Aindrī, Who Took the demon Vṛtra’s life-breath!"
11,20,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who In The Form Of Śivadūtī, Of Frightful Visage and Piercing Shrieks, Slew the mighty demon army."
11,21,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Whose Mouth Bares Its Terrifying Teeth and Whose Neck Is Adorned With A Garland Of Skulls; To You, O Cāmuṇḍā, Destroyer of Muṇḍa!"
11,22,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Who Are Good Fortune, Modesty, Great Knowledge, Faith, Prosperity, Satisfaction to the ancestral spirits, Constancy, The Great Night, and The Great Illusion."
11,23,"Salutation be To You, Nārāyaṇī, Most Excellent Sarasvatī, Who Are Intelligence and Well-Being, The Divine Consort and The Dark One, Ever Constant. Be gracious, O You Who Are Supreme!"
11,24,"O Devī, Who Exist In The Form Of All, Who Are The Ruler Of All, Possessing All Power, protect us from fears. O Devī Durgā, salutation be to You!"
11,25,"May This Gentle Face Of Yours, Adorned With Three Eyes, protect us in every way. O Kātyāyanī, salutation be to you!"
11,26,"May Your Terrible, Flaming Trident, Exceedingly Sharp and Destroying all asuras, protect us from dread. O Bhadrakālī, salutation be to You!"
11,27,"May Your bell that destroys the daityas’ life-force and fills the world with its ringing protect us from all evils, O Devī, even As A Mother Protects her children."
11,28,"May Your Sword, smeared with the mire of asuras’ blood and fat and blazing as the sun’s rays, be for our welfare. O Caṇḍikā, we bow to You!"
11,29,"When pleased, You Destroy All Afflictions, but when Displeased, You Thwart all aspirations. No calamity befalls those who have taken refuge In You, and they who resort To You become a refuge to others."
11,30,"O Devī, Multiplying Your Own Form Into Many, You Have Wrought Destruction on the mighty asuras who hate righteousness. O Ambikā, Who Else can accomplish that?"
11,31,"Who Other Than You Abides In All Forms of learning, In The Sacred Texts that Are Lights Of Understanding, In The Primordial Wisdom Of The Vedas? yet Who Else confounds this universe in the darkest abyss of attachment?"
11,32,"Where malevolent beings and venomous serpents lurk, where enemies and thieves abound, where forest conflagrations rage, there and even in mid-ocean You Stand And Protect the universe."
11,33,"O Ruler Of The Universe, You Protect the universe. You Are The Essence Of all things, and You Support All that is. All kings must praise You, O Revered One, and those who bow to You in devotion become the refuge of all."
11,34,"Be Gracious, O Devī. Even As You Have destroyed the asuras, protect us always from the fear of enemies. May You Subdue the evils of all the worlds and great disasters born of ominous portents."
11,35,"To those who bow down To You, Be Gracious, O Devī, Who Remove the afflictions of all and Who Are Worthy of praise by the dwellers of the three worlds. Confer Your Boons Upon The Worlds.’"
11,36,The Devī Said:
11,37,"‘O hosts of gods, I Am The Giver Of Boons. whatever blessing is your heart’s desire, choose that, and I Will Grant it for the welfare of the world.’"
11,38,The gods said:
11,39,"‘O Ruler of all, may You Allay all the miseries of the three worlds and so, too, annihilate our enemies.’"
11,40,The Devī Said:
11,41,"‘When the twenty-eighth cycle in the age of the manu Vaivasvata has come, two other great asuras, also named Śumbha and Niśumbha, will arise."
11,42,"Then Shall I Be Born in the home of the Cowherd Nanda, brought forth From Yaśodā’s womb; and Dwelling in the Vindhya Mountains, I Shall Destroy the two asuras."
11,43,"Again, having Incarnated on earth in a surpassingly horrific form, I Shall Slay the demons descended from Vipracitti."
11,44,"Upon Devouring those fierce asuras, My Teeth Will Become Red Like Pomegranate flowers."
11,45,"Thereafter, In Praise Of Me, The Gods in heaven and the humans in the mortal realm Will Forever Call Me Raktadantikā."
11,46,"Again, when no rain has fallen for a hundred years and there is no water on earth, Then Praised by sages, I Shall Appear, But Not Born Of A Womb."
11,47,"since I Shall Behold the Sages With A Hundred Eyes, humankind Will Glorify Me As Śatāksī."
11,48,"Causing the rains to fall, O gods, I Shall Support The Entire World With Life-Sustaining Vegetables Brought Forth From My Own Substance."
11,49,"Thus Shall I Be Celebrated On Earth As Śākambharī,"
11,50,and then also shall I Slay a great asura called Durgama and thus come to be Celebrated As The Devī Durgā.
11,51,"again, when I Have Assumed A Terrible form in the Himālayas, I Shall Destroy malevolent beings for the protection of the Sages."
11,52,"Then all the Sages, with bodies bowed, will Praise Me. Thus shall I come to be celebrated by the name of Bhīmadevī."
11,53,"When a demon called Aruṇa wreaks great havoc in the three worlds, then shall I assume form as a Swarm Of Countless Bees"
11,54,and Slay the great asura for the welfare of the three worlds. Thus will people everywhere extol Me as Bhrāmarī.
11,55,"And so, whenever danger arises from demonic sources, I shall Descend and bring about the complete destruction of enemies.’”"
12,1,The Devī said:
12,2,“I shall without doubt destroy every misfortune of those who with collected mind will praise Me always with these hymns.
12,3,"Those who recite the destruction of Madhu and Kaiṭabha, the killing of Mahiṣāsura, and the slaying of Śumbha and Niśumbha"
12,4,"with singleness of mind on the eighth, fourteenth, and ninth days of the lunar fortnight, and those who listen with devotion to this supreme poem of My glory"
12,5,"will have no evil befall them, nor any misfortunes arising from wrongdoing. For them there will be neither poverty nor separation from loved ones,"
12,6,"nor danger from enemies, robbers, or kings. Nor at any time will danger arise from weapons, fire, or flood."
12,7,"Therefore this poem of My glory is to be recited by those of concentrated mind and heard always with devotion, for it is the supreme way to well-being."
12,8,"May this glorification of Mine put to rest all misfortunes born of pestilence, and also the three kinds of calamity."
12,9,"Where it is always and rightly recited in My sanctuary, that place shall I never abandon. There My presence is abiding."
12,10,"In the offering of oblations, in worship, in the fire ceremony, and in the great festival, all these deeds of Mine are to be proclaimed and heard."
12,11,"When offerings are made in worship, with or without proper knowledge, I shall receive them gladly and also the fire oblation performed in like manner."
12,12,"At the great annual worship which is performed in the autumn season, those who hear this poem of My glory and are filled with devotion"
12,13,"will be freed by My grace from all afflictions and endowed with wealth, grain, and progeny. Of this there is no doubt."
12,14,"Hearing of My glory, My auspicious manifestations, and My prowess in battles, they become fearless."
12,15,"For those who hear My glorification, their adversaries go to utter destruction. Well-being comes to them, and their families rejoice."
12,16,"For those troubled by nightmares or the ill-boding of stars, at rituals for averting evil this poem of My glory should always be heard."
12,17,"It causes misfortunes and evil portents to subside, and it turns nightmares into sweet dreams."
12,18,"It pacifies children overcome by seizures, and wherever discord divides, it best restores friendship."
12,19,"It is unsurpassed in diminishing the might of all evildoers. Truly its recitation brings about the destruction of fiends, ghosts, and ghouls."
12,20,This entire glorification of mine draws one near to Me.
12,21,"As by the offerings of finest cattle, flowers, gifts, incense, perfumes, and lights, made day and night for a year; and as by the feeding of Brāhmaṇas, by oblations, by consecrated water;"
12,22,and as by diverse other propitiations and offerings; so also by hearing the recital of My auspicious deeds am I pleased.
12,23,"When heard, this poem of My glory removes impurities and grants freedom from disease. The relating of My births confers protection from evil spirits."
12,24,"Since it recounts My deeds in battle, crushing the wicked daityas, when heard, it dispels all fear of enemies."
12,25,Praises uttered by you and the Brāhmanical seers and by Brahmā himself produce an auspicious mind.
12,26,"When in a forest, or on a lonely road, or surrounded by a forest fire, when encircled by robbers in a desolate place or seized by enemies,"
12,27,"when stalked by lions and tigers or wild elephants in the jungle, when imprisoned or sentenced to death by a wrathful king,"
12,28,"when in a wind-tossed boat on the mighty sea or assailed by hurtling weapons in the midst of battle,"
12,29,"when caught in dreadful straits or tormented with agony, whoever remembers these deeds of Mine is freed from danger."
12,30,"By My power, lions and beasts, robbers and enemies flee far away from one who remembers these deeds of mine.”"
12,31,The seer said:
12,32,"“Having spoken thus, the blessed Caṇḍikā, fierce in valor, vanished from the sight of the gods."
12,33,"Their enemies struck down, the gods were delivered from affliction. They reclaimed their own dominions as before, and all partook of their shares in the sacrifices."
12,34,"As for the daityas, after the Devī had slain in battle those two enemies of the gods— Śumbha, the afflictor of the world, terribly fierce and unequaled in prowess,"
12,35,"and Niśumbha, great in valor—the rest of them returned to the netherworld."
12,36,"Thus, O king, does the blessed Devī, though eternal, manifest again and again for the protection of the world."
12,37,"By Her this universe is deluded. She Herself brings forth everything. Entreated, She bestows right knowledge; propitiated, She bestows prosperity."
12,38,"O king, by Her all this universe is pervaded, by Mahākālī, who takes form as the great destroyer at the end of time."
12,39,"At that time, She herself is the great destroyer. Existing from all eternity, She herself becomes the creation. She, the eternal one, sustains all beings."
12,40,"In times of well-being She is indeed good fortune, granting prosperity in the homes of humankind. In times of privation, She exists as misfortune, bringing about ruin."
12,41,"And so, praised and worshiped with flowers, incense, perfumes, and the like, She grants wealth, progeny, and a pure mind established in righteousness.”"
13,1,The seer said:
13,2,"“Thus have I related to you, O king, this supreme glorification of the Devī:"
13,3,"Such is the splendor of the Devī, by whom the world is upheld, and such is the knowledge fashioned by the blessed Viṣṇumāyā."
13,4,"By Her are you and this merchant and other thoughtful people deluded, just as others have been and will be deluded."
13,5,"O great king, take refuge in Her, the Supreme Sovereign. When worshiped, She truly confers enjoyment, heaven, and final liberation on humanity.”"
13,6,Mārkaṇḍeya said:
13,7,"Hearing his words, Suratha the king bowed in reverence to the illustrious seer of steadfast austerities."
13,8,"Despondent over excessive attachment and the loss of his kingdom, he went at once to practice austerities, O great sage, and so did the merchant,"
13,9,"that they might obtain a vision of the Mother. The king and the merchant settled on a riverbank and engaged in spiritual practice, chanting the supreme hymn to the Devī."
13,10,"When they had fashioned an earthen image Of Her on the riverbank, the two of them worshiped The Devī with flowers, incense, fire, and libations of water."
13,11,"Now fasting, now restraining their senses, with minds constant in concentration, they made offerings sprinkled with the blood of their own bodies."
13,12,"When they had worshiped Her in this way with self- restraint for three years, Caṇḍikā, The Support Of The Universe, Was Well Pleased. She Appeared Before Them And Spoke."
13,13,The Devī Said:
13,14,"“That which you desire, O king, and you, the delight of your family,"
13,15,"receive all that from Me. Well pleased, I will grant it.”"
13,16,Mārkaṇḍeya said:
13,17,"Thereupon the king chose a kingdom imperishable even in another lifetime and also his own kingdom here, to be reclaimed by force from his enemies’ control."
13,18,"And then the wise merchant, dispassionate in mind, chose that knowledge which severs attachment from “I” and “mine.”"
13,19,The Devī Said:
13,20,"“In a few days, O king, you will reclaim your own kingdom."
13,21,"When your enemies are slain, thenceforth it will assuredly be yours."
13,22,And after your death you will obtain another birth from the sun god Vivasvat.
